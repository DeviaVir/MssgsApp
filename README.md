# Mssgs app
This is an example 'app'. We tried building an app of our own, but think you will do a lot better.

Use this SASS/HTML5 app if you don't want to design everything on your own and use our style.

## index.html
In the source you'll find different <div /> id's which get you through the pages.

## sass/partials/_page.sass
Use fire.app or compass.app to compile the CSS (or rewrite it to CSS, it's your app). You don't need everything from the _page.sass (many is deprecated). Just the ".native" class definitions will be needed.

# Good luck!
